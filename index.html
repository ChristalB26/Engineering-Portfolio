                            fits within the packed (41.9cm x 33cm x 31.1cm) and unpacked (1 ft x 1 ft )
                            volume and area constraints. The device must collect a minimum of three objects from the ground area (zone zero) and
                             place them in different zones with different wall heights through up to three one-minute-long test runs, 
                             if the device advances through each run without modifying the objects or contact out of the zones.</span>

                              performance the collection mechanism proved to be strategic for collecting and storing multiple objects at once. Overall timing played a main factor
                               in the final testing. The design was functional but not in a way that optimized time as the track mobility system took time to reposition the device to collect objects
                                in a certain orientation. In the end, it proved to be a unique approach to the object collection problem.</span>

                During my ABB Robotics internship, I played a key role in advancing projects by creating precise deliverables in SolidWorks for a Lifesciences customer product.
                 These models were critical for Robot Studio simulations, where I translated customer workflows into optimized robotic layouts, accounting for the efficiency of robot movements. 
                 I applied robotics techniques like pick-and-place programming, enabling seamless operation across multiple vial positions.
                  As part of my internship, I developed a proof of concept using the FlexPendant to program the Yumi dual-arm robot, teaching it positions for suctioning and placing fruit flies into designated areas.

                In quality management, I traced nonconformities in a Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) self-audit, documenting findings and recommending revisions which were submitted to management for approval to
                 improve FDA compliance. Using root cause analysis techniques like the 5 Whys and the Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa), I identified underlying issues and revised corrective actions to prevent recurrence.
                  This work ensured readiness for FDA audits, reducing the risk of operational setbacks. By refining root cause analysis methods and conducting more thorough investigations, I improved the quality of preventive
                   action statements, ensuring they were more detailed and actionable.

                        Objective:
                        Due to climate change and agricultural water consumption, locations around the globe face increasing demand for freshwater, depleting lakes and 
                        rivers faster than they can replenish. This has created a need to transport water from abundant areas to water-scarce regions. The design challenge
                         tasks students with the proposal a water pipeline construction design overcoming terrain challenges while optimizing constructability, maintenance, and cost. The
                          final design should incorporate pipeline hydraulic analysis, pump selection, civil excavation planning, foundation design, electrical power supply, and
                           constructability cost estimating.

                            Objective: To develop a MATLAB-based program that processes MRI and tumor images to identify and highlight brain tumors within 30 seconds. 
                            This project aimed to streamline the image analysis process by validating image inputs, detecting tumors, and visually representing the results.
                            <br><br>
                            How: The program was implemented through three key stages
                            <ul class="inside">
                                <li>Image loading and Validation: Ensured the MRI and tumor images were compatible by checking size and viewability. If incompatible, the program terminates with error messages, using error handling.</li>
                                <li>Algorithmic Tumor Detection: Employed logical operations and image indexing to locate matching pixels between MRI and tumor images. Used nested loops for pixel comparison, and applied matrix manipulation, image comparison, and logical indexing to detect and output the tumor's location when present.</li>
                                <li>Visualization: Highlighted the detected tumor directly on the MRI scan, with pixel value adjustment to change the color of the detected tumor's corresponding pixels.</li>
                              </ul>
                            <p class="proj-text">Results: The program handles errors reliably for invalid image inputs. It can identify the presence of a tumor in an MRI scan. 
                                The program outputs in the command window the pixel coordinates the tumor is in-between or gives an output that no tumor can be found within 30 seconds.
                                 Lastly, it takes the image of the MRI and redisplays it with the tumor highlighted.
